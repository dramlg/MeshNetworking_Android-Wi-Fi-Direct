# MeshNetworking_Android-Wi-Fi-Direct

MANET networks are those in which we donÂ´t need a centered access point so as to stablish a connection between two mobile points within the network. Indeed, we are able to stablish peer to peer connection without that centered access point, being able to come up with utterly useful applications. In this project, design and development of an application using MANET network is going to be figured out.

MANET network applications have always been coded using Bluetooth technology. Nevertheless, in this project, we are researching a new way so as to develop the communication technology in MANET network applications. This new way will be Wi-Fi Direct technology. Inasmuch as Wi-Fi Direct will provide us a faster throughput rate, a more strength signal, than Bluetooth technology, it will be an utterly improvement in MANET formation applications.

In design part, a wide range of different MANET topologies, formation algorithms, and routing protocols will be explained. We will study different and possible uses of MANET networks, such as military application, applications for places without mobile signal, applications for natural disasters, and so on. Insofar as Wi-Fi Direct will be the communication technology, it will be researched and compared to Bluetooth, commonly and currently used in MANET networks.
	
In development part, the final application will be built. In order to do that, Android mobile operative system will be used, and therefore, Java   will be our programming language. First and foremost, the network formation will be coded, using Wi-Fi Direct technology. Consequently, we have to figure out and justify the best formation algorithm, the best topology, and routing protocols, among existing ones that we have studied in design part. Once the application is able to create a MANET network, high level services of Chat and file transference will be coded. As far as possible, network formation code and high-level services code will be programmed in modular blocks, so that when the network is created, services implementation is the same that service implementation in a common network. Chat service will allow network users to send and receive text messages to each other. File transference service will make use of network clusterhead as cloud file server, so that client users will upload and download files from it.
